Spooky

215/2022 - Teodora Maksimovic   

Project showcases a scene that initially contains a floor, bench and street lamp.
The scene implements both directional and dynamic lighting with a toggleable spotlight
that can be turned on and off by pressing the L key. 
The spotlight features customizable color control - pressing the R key cycles through different 
red component intensities (from 0.2/1.0 to 1.2/2.0 in 0.1 increments), allowing adjustment of 
the spotlight's color from cool blueish to warm reddish tones. 
When the spotlight is activated, a toy model appears in the scene.
Toy moves continuously at constant speed, until the end of the bench is reached. At the end, 
it waits 1 second then returns to the beginning.
After 2 seconds, lamp turns off.
